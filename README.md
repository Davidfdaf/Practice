# Practice


My name is David Fitzpatrick. I am in my first year of my masters in financial engineering and financial data science. I previously worked as a data scientist at the University of Maine on a variety of data analysis and machine learning problems related to a data set of coparenting survey responses. during this time I became working on financial data science problems.  I joined this program to continue discovering the application of data science to finance. To this end, I have worked on projects relating to forming long-term retirement portfolios with favorable statistical characteristics using bayesian optimization algortihms and Identifying the value or lack of value economic factors have in predicting stock returns. I want to continue to improve my quantitative analysis skills through this class. an example of a typical financial time series dataset can be found below.
