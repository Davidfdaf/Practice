# Practice


My name is David Fitzpatrick. I am in my first year of my masters in financial engineering and financial data science. I previously worked as a data scientist at the University of Maine on a variety of data analysis and machine learning problems related to a data set of coparenting survey responses. I now want to work on financial data science problems. To this end, I have worked on projects relating to forming long-term retirement portfolios with favorable statistical characteristics and examining the evolution of assets statistical relationship over time.
